# Bias Blocker Project 

We would like to annotate the codebook according to the following structure.

Both **"Media Bias Project" (BABE)** and **"Automatically Neutralizing Subjective Bias in Text"** projects follow the following structure:

There are 3 main bias types (epistemological, framing, categorical and demographic) and 2 sub-types, which would consider nuances of framing bias.

## Bias Types in A Nutshell

### Framing Bias

- Word choice (nouns or phases: people, places, things, ideas, concepts)
Examples: Name tags such as slurs, derogatory terms, one-sided terms, ideologically driven depictions

- Labelling (adverbs or adjectives: describing nouns and pronouns)
           The usage of adjectives or adverbs that convey a strong opinion (i.e.ineffective)
### Epistemological Bias 

Misleading use of verbs such as factive verbs (claim, boast, expose) 

### Demographic Bias
This type of biased text has presuppositions about particular genders, races, or other demographic categories (policeman, his/her…)

Important Note: Bias topics would be gender, ethnicity, race, age, religion etc.

## Bias Types

### Framing Bias: 

This type of bias alters the reader's opinion by describing an event only from one particular point of view or frame. 

For example, like stance, framing bias is realized when the writer of a text takes a particular position on a controversial topic and uses its metaphors and vocabulary (Recasens, -Niculescu-Mizil, Jurafsky).

Linguistically, there are two ways to do this:

The use of word choice.

A word that might alter a reader’s point of view about an issue, mostly a noun.

The sentence might include slurs, derogatory terms, one-sided terms, ideologically-driven depictions of concepts, individuals or groups of people. Basically name tags that would indicate a set of exclusionary and belief-driven conceptualizations. 

The following examples are from the “Media Bias - BABE” project and “Linguistic Models for Analyzing and Detecting Biased Language” article.

The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.

Usually, smaller cottage-style houses have been demolished to make way for these   McMansions. 

Correction: Usually, smaller cottage-style houses have been demolished to make way for these homes.


### Labelling:

The usage of adjectives or adverbs that convey a strong opinion in that context introduces bias. Usually about an actor, location or event with subjective intensifiers.  

The following examples are from the “Media Bias - BABE” project.

In the months that followed, all independent polling has found the American mainstream not only blames Trump and his party for the shutdown, but also does not want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective and unnecessary border wall.

More than 100 gang members from El Salvador are among the massive wave of migrants that's poured across the border in recent months, [...], beleaguered border officials said.

In July 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats visited a similar processing center in Clint, Texas, and made explosive allegations about the conditions there.

Rather than reducing federal subsidies to universities and placing the leftist institutions at the mercy of the free market, Obama wants to increase the amount students can borrow with interest from the government.

### Epistemological Bias:
		 	 	 		
This class of biased language is often harder to detect than framing bias because of its subtle nature. It encompasses language constructs that aim at manipulating the believability of a statement. The typical mechanisms are either presupposing the truth or the falsehood of a statement. The misleading use of verbs (i.e. factive verbs) is common.

For instance, using verbs such as “boast” or “claim” leads the reader to examine the statement more critically compared to the verbs such as “say” or “state”.

As a result, statements seem to be either more believable or less. The misleading use of verbs (i.e. factive verbs) is common. The following examples are from the “Media Bias - BABE” project and “Linguistic Models for Analyzing and Detecting Biased Language” article.

He realized that the oppression of black people was more of a result of economic exploitation than anything innately racist.

Correction:  His opinion was that the oppression of black people was more of a result of    economic exploitation than anything innately racist.

The Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment - a trade-o Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway.

Correction: The Republican president aimed at helping the industry at the expense of the environment - a trade-o Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway.

Correction: Former ESPN personality Jemele Hill attacked the NFL for its lack of black coaches, and accused the Rooney Rule as an insufficient solution to the problem.

So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asy- lum in the United States, there is no security crisis.

Correction: So while there is a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.

Kuypers claimed that the mainstream press in America tends to favor liberal viewpoints. 

Correction: Kuypers stated that the mainstream press in America tends to favor liberal viewpoints.

### Demographic Bias

This type of biased text has presuppositions (prejudices or preconceptions) about particular genders, ethnicities, nationalities, professions, age groups, health status, religion, or other demographic categories. For instance, assuming that all programmers are male or nurses are female.

Our work initially covers topics of gender and racial-ethnical bias.

A lead programmer usually spends his career in obscurity. 

Correction: Lead programmers usually spend their careers in obscurity. 

The lyrics are about mankind’s perceived idea of hell. 

Correction: The lyrics are about humanity’s perceived idea of hell. 

Note: Pronouns such as his/her should be replaced by “them”.


And here are some other examples from different bias topics (from Chatgpt actually):

Racial or Ethnic Bias: Making assumptions about someone's abilities, intelligence, or behavior based solely on their race or ethnicity. For example, assuming someone is good at math just because they're of Asian descent.

Gender Bias: Believing that one gender is more suited for a particular job or role than another. For instance, assuming that women are more nurturing and thus better suited for roles like nursing or teaching, while men are more analytical and better suited for roles in engineering.

Age Bias: Making assumptions about someone's capabilities, interests, or abilities based on their age. An example would be believing that older people can't understand technology or that younger people are inherently more innovative.

Religious Bias: Assuming someone's values, beliefs, or behaviors based on their religion. For example, believing all individuals of a certain religion are conservative or hold extreme views.

Socioeconomic Bias: Making assumptions about someone's intelligence, capabilities, or worth based on their socioeconomic status. For instance, thinking that someone from a low-income background isn't as educated or capable.

Profession-based Bias: Holding assumptions about someone's personality or abilities based on their profession. For example, believing that all lawyers are manipulative or that all artists are eccentric.

Educational Bias: Judging someone's intelligence or capabilities based on where (or if) they went to college.

National or Regional Bias: Assuming things about a person based on the country or region they come from. For example, believing that someone from a specific country is inherently punctual, lazy, efficient, or friendly.


### Important Note:

- In many cases, there can be more bias types and topics. Please note and annotate all types and topics you can cover.
